    "# 1. Purpose of experiment and data analyses\n",
    "These experiments were conducted to investigate the dependency of the structural durability of (high fibre volume fraction) carbon fibre/epoxy laminate composites on fibre orientation. Quasi-static tensile and compressive fatigue tests were performed with unidirectional (UD) carbon/epoxy laminates at angles of 0°, 45° and 90°.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Why these investigations are needed\n",
    "1. Short and long-fibre reinforced composites offer advantages over conventional metallic materials for the manufacture of components across many different manufacturing industries (*common examples: aerospace/automotive component manufacture, building materials, sports equipment, chemical process industry components*)\n",
    "    * Polymeric laminated composites, like carbon-fibre/epoxy laminates, present high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios when compared with metallic materials\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To dimension parts undergoing sustained tensile or compressive forces in application, and the material's consequent deformation response, the quasi-fatigue tensile & compressive characterization testing is necessary\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *My personal opinion*: Composite materials design offers, for all practical intents and purposes, virtually limitless options for component design, processing and application-use. Consequently, this mean that, for the foreseeable future, there will be an ongoing need to conduct testing for both existing and novel composite materials design and structural analyses; the evolution of innovation in composite materials development and processing technologies will further expand the scope of testing needed."
