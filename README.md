This repo showcases a small portfolio of performance polymer & composite materials characterization testing projects that I completed throughout my graduate education at the Johannes Kepler University Linz (Linz, Austria). The repo is formatted as a 'Digital Laboratory Notebook', based on my master thesis project work at the ETH Zürich (Zürich, Switzerland), showcasing the flexibility and powerful computing capabilities for (composite) materials characterization testing and experiment data analysis computing with the Python, MATLAB and R programming languages and interactive computing platforms (Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab).
